                  The history of coffee is deeply-rooted in the Arab world and specifically within the <strong>Arabian Peninsula</strong>. There are many arguments that the origins of coffee started from either <strong>Yemen</strong> or <strong>Ethiopia</strong>. Both countries are with great coffee heritage yet the Arabs have played an important role in the development of coffee from the moment it was first discovered in <strong>Yemen</strong> up to this day. It is well noted that <strong>Arabs</strong> were the first to roast and boil coffee, making way for the beverage that is enjoyed by <strong>billions of people around the world</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This tradition of enjoying coffee among the <strong>Arabs</strong> and in the <strong>Muslim world</strong> continued to develop and grow throughout the <strong>13th century</strong>. Ever since, <strong>Arabs</strong> understood the values of coffee though its stimulating effects and awakening characteristics through which they have been enjoying ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Coffee</strong> shops – or coffee houses, <strong>‘Qahwa’</strong> – or <strong>‘MaQha,’</strong> began spreading and have become part of a social experience where people went to relax and enjoy conversations. It has gone beyond just a place to enjoy a beverage but a place to exchange knowledge, wisdom, and information; which is not too different from today’s world. <strong>The Q lab</strong> is a testament to the history of <strong>‘Qahwa,’</strong> or <strong>Coffee</strong>, as it is known today in the <strong>Arab</strong> world in bringing some of the world’s most exclusive coffees for people to experience and understand the history and complexity of this unique beverage.
